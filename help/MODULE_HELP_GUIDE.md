## ‚ö†Ô∏è RISK MANAGEMENT - Complete Guide

### What It Does
Calculates optimal position sizes and helps manage portfolio risk using professional risk management techniques.

### Step-by-Step Usage

**Step 1: Enter Trade Parameters**
- Stock symbol and entry price
- Stop loss level
- Account size (total trading capital)
- Risk percentage per trade

**Step 2: Review Calculations**
- Recommended position size
- Maximum loss amount
- Portfolio allocation percentage
- Risk/reward ratio

**Step 3: Apply Risk Rules**
- Position size guidelines
- Diversification requirements  
- Risk monitoring tools

### Real Example Risk Calculation

**Trade Setup:**
```
üìä TRADE PARAMETERS:
‚Ä¢ Symbol: AAPL
‚Ä¢ Entry Price: $175.00
‚Ä¢ Stop Loss: $165.00
‚Ä¢ Account Size: $100,000
‚Ä¢ Risk Per Trade: 2%
```

**Risk Calculations:**
```
üí∞ RISK ANALYSIS:
‚Ä¢ Risk Per Share: $10.00 ($175 - $165)
‚Ä¢ Maximum Risk Amount: $2,000 (2% of $100,000)
‚Ä¢ Recommended Position Size: 200 shares ($2,000 √∑ $10)
‚Ä¢ Total Investment: $35,000 (200 √ó $175)
‚Ä¢ Portfolio Allocation: 35% of total account
‚Ä¢ Capital Efficiency: 5.7% risk for 35% allocation

üéØ RISK/REWARD SETUP:
‚Ä¢ Stop Loss: $165.00 (-5.7% from entry)
‚Ä¢ Target 1: $190.00 (+8.6% gain, 1.5:1 R/R)
‚Ä¢ Target 2: $195.00 (+11.4% gain, 2:1 R/R)
‚Ä¢ Optimal R/R Target: $195.00 for 2:1 ratio
```

### Position Sizing Methods

**Fixed Percentage Risk:**
```
Formula: Position Size = (Account Risk $) √∑ (Entry Price - Stop Loss)

Example:
‚Ä¢ Account: $50,000
‚Ä¢ Risk: 2% = $1,000
‚Ä¢ Entry: $100, Stop: $95
‚Ä¢ Position Size = $1,000 √∑ $5 = 200 shares
```

**Fixed Dollar Risk:**
```
Set maximum dollar loss per trade regardless of account size

Example:
‚Ä¢ Max Risk: $1,000 per trade
‚Ä¢ Entry: $50, Stop: $45  
‚Ä¢ Position Size = $1,000 √∑ $5 = 200 shares
‚Ä¢ Works for consistent risk regardless of wins/losses
```

**Volatility-Based Sizing:**
```
Adjust position size based on stock volatility (ATR)

High Volatility Stock (ATR = $5):
‚Ä¢ Wider stops needed
‚Ä¢ Smaller position size
‚Ä¢ Example: 100 shares with $10 stop

Low Volatility Stock (ATR = $1):  
‚Ä¢ Tighter stops possible
‚Ä¢ Larger position size
‚Ä¢ Example: 500 shares with $2 stop
```

### Risk Management Rules

**The 2% Rule:**
- Never risk more than 2% of account on single trade
- Preserves capital during losing streaks
- Allows for 50 consecutive losses before account gone
- Professional standard for risk management

**The 6% Rule:**
- Never have more than 6% total portfolio risk at once
- Maximum 3 positions at 2% risk each
- Prevents overexposure to market volatility
- Maintains diversification requirements

**The 10% Rule:**
- No single position over 10% of total portfolio
- Prevents concentration risk
- Ensures proper diversification
- Allows for position sizing flexibility

### Portfolio Risk Metrics

**Value at Risk (VaR):**
```
üìä PORTFOLIO VaR ANALYSIS:
‚Ä¢ 1-Day VaR (95% confidence): -$2,850
‚Ä¢ Meaning: 95% chance daily loss won't exceed $2,850
‚Ä¢ 5% chance of larger loss on any given day
‚Ä¢ Based on historical volatility and correlations
```

**Maximum Drawdown:**
```
üìâ DRAWDOWN ANALYSIS:
‚Ä¢ Current Drawdown: -3.2% from peak
‚Ä¢ Maximum Historical: -12.5%
‚Ä¢ Recovery Time: Average 45 days
‚Ä¢ Acceptable Level: Below -15%
```

**Risk-Adjusted Returns:**
```
üìà SHARPE RATIO ANALYSIS:
‚Ä¢ Current Sharpe: 1.65
‚Ä¢ Risk-Free Rate: 3.5%
‚Ä¢ Excess Return: 8.2%
‚Ä¢ Volatility: 12.8%
‚Ä¢ Interpretation: Good risk-adjusted performance
```

### Stop Loss Strategies

**Technical Stop Losses:**
- **Support Levels**: Below key support areas
- **Moving Averages**: Below 20-day or 50-day MA
- **Pattern Stops**: Below pattern lows (hammer, doji)
- **Percentage Stops**: Fixed % below entry (5-8%)

**Trailing Stops:**
```
üìà TRAILING STOP EXAMPLE:
‚Ä¢ Initial Entry: $100
‚Ä¢ Initial Stop: $95 (5% stop)
‚Ä¢ Stock rises to $110
‚Ä¢ Trailing Stop: $104.50 (5% below current high)
‚Ä¢ Locks in profit while allowing upside
```

**Time-Based Stops:**
- **Swing Trades**: Exit if no progress in 2-3 weeks
- **Day Trades**: Exit at end of day regardless
- **Momentum Plays**: Exit if momentum stalls
- **Earnings Plays**: Exit before/after earnings event

### Position Management Strategies

**Scaling Into Positions:**
```
üéØ SCALE-IN EXAMPLE:
‚Ä¢ Total Planned Position: 300 shares AAPL
‚Ä¢ Entry 1: 100 shares at $175 (test position)
‚Ä¢ Entry 2: 100 shares at $172 (if pullback)
‚Ä¢ Entry 3: 100 shares at $178 (if breakout)
‚Ä¢ Average Cost: Depends on fills received
```

**Scaling Out of Positions:**
```
üí∞ SCALE-OUT EXAMPLE:
‚Ä¢ Total Position: 300 shares at $175 avg cost
‚Ä¢ Exit 1: 100 shares at $185 (take some profit)
‚Ä¢ Exit 2: 100 shares at $195 (take more profit)  
‚Ä¢ Exit 3: 100 shares at stop or final target
‚Ä¢ Risk Management: Reduce risk as trade works
```

### Correlation Risk Management

**Portfolio Correlation Analysis:**
```
üìä CORRELATION MATRIX:
‚Ä¢ AAPL vs MSFT: 0.75 (high correlation)
‚Ä¢ AAPL vs TSLA: 0.45 (moderate correlation)
‚Ä¢ AAPL vs JNJ: 0.15 (low correlation)

‚ö†Ô∏è RISK IMPLICATIONS:
‚Ä¢ High correlation = similar moves
‚Ä¢ Avoid overweight in correlated positions
‚Ä¢ Diversify across uncorrelated assets
```

**Sector Concentration Risk:**
```
üìà SECTOR ALLOCATION:
‚Ä¢ Technology: 45% (overweight - reduce)
‚Ä¢ Healthcare: 20% (appropriate)
‚Ä¢ Finance: 15% (appropriate)
‚Ä¢ Energy: 10% (underweight - consider adding)
‚Ä¢ Consumer: 10% (appropriate)
```
